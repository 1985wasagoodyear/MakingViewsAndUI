#  Programmatic

## Pros:

* Easy to identify changes without Interface Builder/Xcode
* Small size, easily portable for use and sharing
* Creates individual views, easy to reuse
* Least prone to merge conflicts

## Cons:

* Relies entirely on programmatic work, no visualization whatsoever
* Verifying how elements are rendered requires running the project
